# Specification Quality Checklist: OCI-Compliant Registry Server (jreg)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

Key strengths:
- Comprehensive coverage of OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.1 requirements
- Well-prioritized user stories (P1: Push, P2: Pull, P3: Discovery, P4: Lifecycle)
- 35 detailed functional requirements mapping to OCI spec endpoints
- 15 measurable success criteria including OCI conformance test requirements
- Clear entity definitions for core concepts (Repository, Manifest, Blob, Tag, etc.)
- Thorough edge case identification
- Explicit assumptions documented

The specification provides sufficient detail for technical planning without prescribing implementation approaches.
