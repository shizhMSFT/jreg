# Server Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. API-First Design

**All server functionality MUST be exposed through well-defined, versioned APIs:**

- **Contract Definition**: OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas MUST be defined before implementation. Contracts are the source of truth.
- **Versioning**: APIs MUST follow semantic versioning (v1, v2). Breaking changes require new major version.
- **RESTful Conventions**: REST APIs MUST follow HTTP semantics correctly - GET (idempotent), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (remove).
- **Response Standards**: All responses MUST include proper HTTP status codes, consistent error format, and request correlation IDs.
- **Input Validation**: All inputs MUST be validated at API boundary. Reject invalid requests with 400 Bad Request and clear error messages.
- **Documentation**: APIs MUST include OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with examples, error codes, and authentication requirements.

**Rationale**: APIs are contracts with consumers. Clear, stable APIs enable independent development, versioned evolution, and confident integration.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The TDD cycle is mandatory for all feature development:**

1. **Write Tests First**: Define acceptance criteria as failing tests before writing implementation code.
2. **User Approval**: If tests are derived from user stories, ensure user validates test scenarios before implementation begins.
3. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Tests MUST fail initially (Red), implementation makes them pass (Green), then refactor for quality (Refactor).
4. **Independent Testability**: Each user story MUST be independently testable. Tests for Story N cannot depend on Story M.
5. **Coverage Gates**: Unit test coverage MUST exceed 80%. Integration tests MUST cover all user-facing workflows. Contract tests MUST validate all API boundaries.
6. **Test Pyramid**: Follow the test pyramid - many unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal E2E tests.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are clear before coding begins, provides instant regression detection, and creates living documentation of system behavior.

### III. Observability & Monitoring

**All server operations MUST be observable and measurable:**

- **Structured Logging**: Use structured JSON logging with consistent fields (timestamp, level, service, trace_id, message, context).
- **Log Levels**: ERROR (actionable failures), WARN (degraded state), INFO (significant events), DEBUG (troubleshooting). No logging in hot paths without sampling.
- **Metrics**: Expose Prometheus-compatible metrics - request rate, latency (p50/p95/p99), error rate, resource usage.
- **Health Checks**: Implement `/health` (liveness) and `/ready` (readiness) endpoints. Health checks MUST complete in <1 second.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Propagate trace context (trace_id, span_id) across service boundaries. Instrument critical paths.
- **Error Tracking**: Unhandled exceptions MUST be logged with full stack traces and context. Integrate with error tracking systems.
- **Audit Logging**: Security-sensitive operations (auth, data access, config changes) MUST be audited with user identity and timestamp.

**Rationale**: Production issues are inevitable. Comprehensive observability enables rapid diagnosis, data-driven optimization, and proactive issue detection.

### IV. Performance & Scalability

**Server performance directly impacts user experience and operational costs:**

- **Response Time Budgets**: API endpoints MUST respond within 200ms (p95) for synchronous requests. Long operations use async patterns with polling/webhooks.
- **Concurrency**: Design for concurrent request handling. Avoid global locks. Use connection pooling for databases and external services.
- **Database Optimization**: N+1 queries are prohibited. Use appropriate indexes. Query plans MUST be reviewed for endpoints handling >100 req/s.
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache immutable or slow-changing data. Define TTLs explicitly. Implement cache invalidation strategy.
- **Rate Limiting**: All public endpoints MUST implement rate limiting. Return 429 with Retry-After header.
- **Load Testing**: Performance tests MUST simulate target load (concurrent users, request patterns). Run in CI for critical paths.
- **Resource Limits**: Configure memory limits, connection pools, and timeouts. Document capacity planning assumptions.

**Rationale**: Slow servers drive users away and increase infrastructure costs. Performance requirements guide architectural choices and prevent costly post-launch refactoring.

### V. Security by Default

**Security is non-negotiable and MUST be built into every layer:**

- **Authentication**: All APIs MUST require authentication unless explicitly designed as public. Support token-based auth (JWT, OAuth2).
- **Authorization**: Implement least-privilege access control. Verify permissions for every protected operation.
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all inputs. Prevent injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, command injection, XSS).
- **Secrets Management**: NEVER commit secrets to version control. Use environment variables or secret management systems. Rotate secrets regularly.
- **HTTPS Only**: All production endpoints MUST use TLS 1.2+. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Implement HSTS headers.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Run dependency vulnerability scans in CI. Block merges with critical/high severity vulnerabilities.
- **Security Headers**: Implement security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security).
- **Audit Trail**: Log authentication attempts, authorization failures, and sensitive data access with user context.

**Rationale**: Security breaches have catastrophic consequences - data loss, regulatory fines, reputation damage. Security must be architectural, not applied as patches.

## Deployment & Operations

**Server deployment and operations MUST follow these practices:**

### Environment Management

- **Configuration**: Use environment variables for configuration. Support `.env` files for local development.
- **Environment Parity**: Development, staging, and production MUST use same configuration mechanism. Minimize environment-specific code.
- **Secrets**: Store secrets in secure vault systems (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault). Never in environment variables in production.
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for gradual rollouts. Disable features without deployment.

### Deployment Standards

- **Zero Downtime**: Deployments MUST not cause service interruption. Use rolling updates or blue-green deployments.
- **Rollback Plan**: Every deployment MUST have documented rollback procedure. Practice rollbacks in staging.
- **Database Migrations**: Migrations MUST be backwards compatible for zero-downtime deployment. Test migration on production-like data volumes.
- **Health Checks**: Deployment automation MUST verify health checks pass before routing traffic to new instances.
- **Smoke Tests**: Run automated smoke tests post-deployment to verify critical paths.

### Monitoring & Alerting

- **SLIs/SLOs**: Define Service Level Indicators (latency, availability, error rate) and Objectives (99.9% uptime, p95 < 200ms).
- **Alerts**: Configure alerts for SLO violations, error rate spikes, resource exhaustion. Alert on symptoms, not causes.
- **On-Call Runbooks**: Document troubleshooting steps for common alerts. Include links to dashboards, logs, and escalation contacts.
- **Incident Response**: Define incident severity levels and response procedures. Conduct post-incident reviews.

### Resource Management

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design stateless services that scale horizontally. Store session state externally (Redis, database).
- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pools for databases and external services. Configure appropriate pool sizes.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handle SIGTERM gracefully - finish in-flight requests, close connections, release resources.
- **Resource Limits**: Configure CPU and memory limits in container orchestration. Monitor and adjust based on actual usage.

## Quality Gates

**All code changes MUST pass the following gates before merging:**

1. **Tests Pass**: All existing and new tests MUST pass. Flaky tests MUST be fixed or quarantined, not ignored.
2. **Coverage Maintained**: Code coverage MUST NOT decrease. New code MUST achieve minimum 80% coverage.
3. **Security Scan**: Dependency vulnerability scan MUST pass. No critical/high severity vulnerabilities. Document accepted risks for medium/low.
4. **API Contract**: API changes MUST update OpenAPI/GraphQL schema. Breaking changes require version bump and deprecation notice.
5. **Linting Clean**: Static analysis and linting MUST pass with zero warnings. Suppressions require inline justification.
6. **Review Approved**: At least one peer review approval required. Reviewers verify correctness, security, principle compliance, and test adequacy.
7. **Performance Validated**: Endpoints MUST meet response time budgets. Load test critical paths. Benchmark database queries.
8. **Observability**: New endpoints MUST include logging, metrics, and error tracking. Critical operations MUST have distributed tracing.
9. **Documentation Updated**: API changes MUST update documentation. Deployment changes MUST update runbooks.
10. **Constitution Compliance**: Changes MUST align with constitutional principles. Violations require justification and approval.

**Enforcement**: Automated checks in CI for items 1-3, 5, 7-8. Human review for items 4, 6, 9-10. Merge blocked until all gates pass.
